### What Are Quantum Computers?

>A mode of computing that operates by quantum mechanical phenomena.

---
![The European Quantum Computing Startup Landscape | by Alex Kiltz | UVC Partners News | Medium](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmiro.medium.com%2Fmax%2F1400%2F1*Z2xSe0J7Tr_QjFoF38G-Cw.jpeg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=f2a75131f483bc07009c1b656fbfb7b8edf7820fdc5428077b90ad5b199cb1f5&ipo=images)

notes:
- This mode is fundamentally different from how classical computers work and is not intended to replace them. 
- If it's not supposed to replace computers, what are their purpose? Quantum Computers can solve problems that are intractable (too complex to solve) with traditional computing, transcending classical time complexity.

---
### How do Quantum Computers Work?

> The principal difference between these two systems are their possible states.

---

![[bitqubit-844033514.jpg]]

notes:
- Classical computers can only exist in one state, while quantum computers can be in many states at the same time.
- The states of a classical computer are represented by bits - either 1 or 0 (binary) e.g a light switch
- Quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits) to accomplish this. Instead of being just 0 or 1, they are in a superposition, with some probability of being either 0 or 1. Once measured, they will probablistically output either 0 or 1. 
- The number of qubits corresponds to the processing power of the quantum computer, just like increasing the number of transistors on a classical computer.

---

### Superposition

![[Superposition.gif]]

> The ability to represent multiple states simultaneously.


notes:
- This is the bread and butter that gives Quantum Computers the edge.

---
#### What happens when there is more than one qubit?
---
### Entanglement

![[HelplessHighlevelEelelephant-size_restricted-3055313824.gif]]

 > Qubits are dependent of eachother 

${Possible States=}$ ${ 2^n}$  where ${n}$ = number of qubits
 
notes:
	- In a classical computer bits are indepedent of each other, that is to say the state of one bit does not affect the state of any other bits
	- Qubits can be entangled with eachother, becoming one large quantum state. They are connected and the outcome is dependent on eachother, forming one large probability distribution. 
	- A quantum computer with 268 qubits contians more possible states than there are atoms(estimated) in the observable universe.

### Interference

![[Pasted image 20230421151237.png]]

 > The net effect of combining two or more waves

notes:
- Particles are seen when they are measured, but their movement is described by wave functions.
- The bloch sphere is a useful visual representation, but qubits are actually described by [[quantum wavefunctions]], which are the fundamental mathematical descriptors of everything in quantum mechanics. 
- You are already familiar with this one, it's the same principal used in classical physics. For example, the ripples of two rocks in a calm pond.

---

![[Pasted image 20230421112338.png]]

> When two or more qubits entangled with eachother, their wavefunctions are added into one overall wave function.

notes:
- Interference at the quantum level through quantum gates allows for the addition and subtraction of wave functions causing constructive and deconstructive interference. Manipulating the wavefunction alters the probability of the superposition (possible states), reinforcing the desired outcome, and negating undesireable ones.

### Impact on CyberSecurity

notes:
- What if I told you that Quantum Computing could break encryption, effectively the internet.

Multipling is Easy

${53 \cdot 7 = 371}$

Factoring is **HARD**

${627,581 = }$ *?* ${\cdot }$ *?*

notes: 
- One of the most common modes of securely transmitting data is called public-key encryption, as seen in RSA and Elliptic Curve key exchange. 
- Public-key schemes rely on the fact that finding prime factors for a large integer Is incredibly difficult. While possible on classical computers, it might take thousands of years. A quantum computer, however, could potentially find these values in a few minutes, using an method called Shor's Algorithm.

---

*?* ${\cdot }$ *?* ${ = N}$

#### Shor's Algorithm

${a \cdot b = N}$

notes:
- Shors Algorithm uses parameter optimization to extract useful information that leads to finding the factors ${a}$ and ${b}$ of some large number ${N}$. The basic steps of the quantum algorithm are as follows:
   
---

1. Guess a random number, ${g}$  that could share factors of the target number ${N}$

---

2. Find how many times we need to multiply ${g}$ by itself to equal ${m \cdot N+1}$. This power is a value called ${p}$, or ${g^p=m \cdot N+1}$

---

- Construct a superposition containing all the possible powers of the equation ${g^x=m \cdot N+1}$
- Measure to find the superposition where the remainder is always ${r}$:  ${g^{x+p}=m \cdot N+r}$,   ${g^{x+2p}=m_2 \cdot N+r}$,   ${g^{x+3p}=m_3 \cdot N+r}$...
- Destructively interfere the superposition using a quantum fourier transform to find the structural relationship or frequency ${\frac{1}{p}}$ that resulted in the remainder ${r}$. 
 
---

3. Take the inverse of ${\frac{1}{p}}$, if ${p}$ is even, plug it into the equation ${g^\frac{p}{2} \pm 1}$, whose value is garunteed to share factors with ${N}$

---

4. Use Euclids Algorithm to quickly find those factors ${a}$ and ${b}$.

---

5. Break encryption and profit off of government secrets

#### Precautionary Measures (Post-Quantum Cryptology)

> Post-quantum cryptography refers to algorithms that are considered secure against attacks from quantum computers

notes:
- Research and development into quantum safe encryption methods is being done today in anticipation for a quantum future.

notes:
- The federal agency NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) who are working on finalizing four algorithms from a 6 year stadardization project. 
- The selection process began in 2017, when they collected 82 "quantum-safe" algorithms for processing. 
- These submissions are being rigorously tested and weeded out. In 2022 here were roughly 15 remaining. This process will continue through the next two years until they make their final selections.

#### How long until the Quantum Computing Apocolypse?

> Current Quantum computers far below the qubit threshold required to break public-key encryption.

notes:
- Quantum Computers are in their early stages, like a baby taking its first steps. 
- In fact, quantum computers are a recent phenomenon and were too complicated to build without the modern technology of the past 25 years.

notes:
- Decoherence (quantum-errors) are reminiscent of 1st gen classical computers that utilized vaccum tubes (instead of transistors), such as the Harvard Mark II that Grace Hopper found a moth inside of. 
- While we may be decades away from 
- It's relatively safe to say that before methods improve and become reliable, through research and microfabrication, we are years, maybe decades from quantum takover of our cryptospace. Given the difficulty to make these computers, that future shouldn't be an overnight suprise. It will instead arrive gradually, giving us time to anticipate its repercussions.
